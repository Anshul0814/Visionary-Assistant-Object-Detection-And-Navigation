# Visionary Assistant : Object Detection And Navigation 
An Assistive Object Detection and Navigation System for the Visually Impaired

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Visionary Assistant is a real-time object detection and OCR-based navigation system designed to support visually impaired individuals.  
The system uses:

- **YOLOv8** for object detection  
- **PyTesseract** for reading text from the environment  
- **Ultrasonic Sensors** for distance estimation  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** feedback for user alerts  
- **Camera input (Webcam or Pi Cam)** for real-time processing  

This helps users understand their surrounding environment and navigate safely with voice-guided instructions.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Real-time object detection  
✔️ Text reading (OCR) using camera feed  
✔️ Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor  
✔️ Supports **Webcam** and **Raspberry Pi Camera**  
✔️ Audio feedback using TTS  
✔️ Lightweight and optimized for Raspberry Pi
